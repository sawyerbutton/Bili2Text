# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Bili2Text is a powerful video transcription tool for Bilibili videos, built with dual architecture:
- **Web Application**: Modern Flask-based web interface with WebSocket real-time updates
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for batch processing and automation

The project uses OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition and provides comprehensive video downloading and transcription capabilities.

## ðŸš§ Project Status: Under Refactoring

**Current Status**: The project is undergoing comprehensive refactoring to improve code quality, security, and maintainability.

**Refactoring Goals**:
- âœ… Clean up codebase (216+ MB saved through file cleanup)
- ðŸ”„ Fix critical security vulnerabilities (URL validation, path traversal)
- ðŸ”„ Eliminate code duplication (500+ lines of repeated code)
- ðŸ”„ Improve architecture (decouple modules, implement shared services)
- ðŸ”„ Standardize error handling and configuration management

**Known Issues Being Addressed**:
- TaskManager methods are too long (150+ lines)
- Security vulnerabilities in URL validation and file path handling
- Code duplication between CLI and Web modules
- Reverse dependencies violating layered architecture
- Memory issues with large file transcription

## Architecture Overview

### Dual-Mode Design
The project implements a shared-core architecture where both web and CLI applications use common libraries from `src/`:
- **CLI Mode** (`cli/`): Command-line tools for automation and batch processing
- **Web Mode** (`webapp/`): Full-featured web application with real-time updates
- **Shared Core** (`src/`): Common transcription, downloading, and utility functions

### Key Components

#### Web Application Structure
- `webapp/app.py`: Flask application factory with SocketIO integration
- `webapp/api/routes.py`: RESTful API endpoints for task management
- `webapp/core/`: Core business logic (task management, file handling, system monitoring)
- `webapp/static/`: Frontend assets (HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript)

#### CLI Tool Structure
- `cli/main.py`: Unified CLI entry point with subcommands
- `cli/download_audio.py`: Audio transcription functionality
- `cli/download_video.py`: Video download functionality
- `cli/get_dynamics.py`: Dynamic content retrieval

#### Shared Libraries
- `src/transcriber/`: Whisper-based transcription engine (ðŸ”„ Under refactoring)
- `src/downloader/`: Video/audio download utilities (ðŸ”„ Under refactoring) 
- `src/utils/`: Common utility functions (âœ… Path management refactored)
- `src/models/`: Data models and schemas (ðŸ”„ To be implemented)
- `src/events/`: Event bus for decoupled communication (ðŸ”„ To be implemented)
- `src/exceptions/`: Unified exception handling (ðŸ”„ To be implemented)

### Configuration System
- `config/app/`: Environment-specific configurations
- `config/models/`: Whisper model configurations
- Multiple requirement files for different deployment scenarios

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket integration for live progress updates
- Task status broadcasting to connected clients
- System monitoring with real-time performance metrics

## Whisper Models Available
- `tiny`: Fastest, lower accuracy (39MB)
- `base`: Balanced performance (74MB)
- `medium`: Recommended for most use cases (769MB)
- `large-v3`: Highest accuracy (1550MB)

## Storage Structure
```
storage/
â”œâ”€â”€ audio/     # Downloaded audio files
â”œâ”€â”€ video/     # Downloaded video files
â”œâ”€â”€ results/   # Transcription results
â””â”€â”€ temp/      # Temporary processing files
```

## Database Schema
- SQLite database with Task, SystemStatus, and TaskStatistics models
- Automatic database initialization on first run
- Migration support through SQLAlchemy

## Error Handling
The project implements comprehensive error handling:
- Frontend: Global error handler with retry mechanisms and user-friendly messages
- Backend: Unified exception middleware with structured error responses
- Test page available at `/error-test` for error handling verification
